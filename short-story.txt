Daya saw an ad in the paper for free coloring books. She loves to color.
So the next day Daya decided to write a letter and ask for some of the free coloring books.
She filled out the order form and added a short letter. 
She addressed the envelope and put the letter inside. She sealed the envelope and put a stamp on it.
After she mailed the letter, she wondered how long it would take for the coloring books to come in the mail.
When the coloring book arrived, it was her favorite animal Dogs!
